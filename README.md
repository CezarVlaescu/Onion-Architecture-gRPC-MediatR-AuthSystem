# Onion-Architecture---MediatR---gRPC-


Onion Architecture: This is a software architectural pattern that promotes maintaining the software's core independent of its interface or infrastructure. In this architecture, the application is built around an inner core, and it's structured in several layers.

*Core Layer: This is the center of the Onion Architecture. It contains the application's business logic and models. In a C# application, these would be your domain entities and interfaces that define business rules and operations.

*Application Layer: Surrounding the core layer, this layer contains the application logic. It acts as a bridge between the core and the outer layers. It typically contains services, implementations of interfaces from the core, and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).

*Infrastructure Layer: This is the outermost layer. It contains elements like data access logic, external services implementations, and third-party API integrations. In C#, this would include Entity Framework for database operations, email service providers, etc.

*Presentation Layer: Not always visualized as a part of the Onion Architecture but important in application design. It's where the UI (User Interface) resides. In a C# application, this could be an MVC (Model-View-Controller) web app, a desktop application, or even a mobile application.

*gRPC: It stands for gRPC Remote Procedure Calls. gRPC is an open-source remote procedure call system initially developed by Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and it provides features like authentication, load balancing, and more.

In the context of Onion Architecture in a C# application:

Services Definition: Using Protocol Buffers, you define your services and the messages they exchange. These definitions are platform-independent, meaning you can have a C# server interacting with a client written in a different language.
Integration in Layers: The gRPC services you define will typically reside in the Infrastructure Layer, where they'll interact with the Application Layer to process business logic. Clients consuming these services can be part of the Presentation Layer.
